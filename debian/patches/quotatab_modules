+                         ProFTPD module mod_quotatab
+
+  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+This module is contained in the mod_quotatab.c, mod_quotatab.h, and in its
+submodule source files, for ProFTPD 1.2, found here, and is not compiled by
+default. Installation instructions can be found here.
+
+This module is designed to impose quotas, both byte- and file-based, on FTP
+accounts, based on user, group, class, or for all accounts. It is based on
+the ideas contained in Eric Estabrook's mod_quota; however, this module has
+been written from scratch to implement quotas in a very different manner. A
+more detailed explanation of the usage of this module follows the directive
+explanations.
+
+The most current version of mod_quotatab's submodules supports storage of
+quota table information in various formats:
+
+   * mod_quotatab_file for file-based quota tables
+   * mod_quotatab_sql for SQL-based quota tables
+
+The most current version of mod_quotatab can be found at:
+
+  http://www.castaglia.org/proftpd/
+
+The eventual goal of this module is to make use of the Confstream API, an
+experimental API described here. This API would make support for tables in
+other formats (e.g. LDAP, CDB, DBM) much easier to implement.

+  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+QuotaDirectoryTally
+
+Syntax: QuotaDirectoryTally on|off
+Default: QuotaDirectoryTally off
+Context: server config, <VirtualHost>, <Global>
+Module: mod_quotatab
+Compatibility: 1.2.5rc2 and later
+
+The QuotaDirectoryTally directive configures mod_quotatab to take directory
+operations (e.g. creating a directory, removing a directory) into account
+when tallying.
+
+  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+QuotaDisplayUnits
+
+Syntax: QuotaDisplayUnits "b"|"Kb"|"Mb"|"Gb"
+Default: None
+Context: server config, <VirtualHost>, <Global>
+Module: mod_quotatab
+Compatibility: 1.2.5rc2 and later
+
+This directive configures how the user's current byte quota values will be
+reported to them. Note that this directive does not affect how the quota
+values are stored in the quota table, only their presentation to the user.
+
+"b" causes quotas to be displayed in bytes; "Kb", kilobytes; "Mb",
+megabytes; and "Gb", gigabytes.
+
+Example:
+
+  # display quota information in megabytes
+  QuotaDisplayUnits Mb
+
+  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+QuotaEngine
+
+Syntax: QuotaEngine on|off
+Default: None
+Context: server config, <VirtualHost>, <Global>
+Module: mod_quotatab
+Compatibility: 1.2.5rc2 and later
+
+The QuotaEngine directive enables or disables the module's runtime quota
+engine. If it is set to off this module does no runtime processing at all.
+Use this directive to disable the module instead of commenting out all
+mod_quotatab directives.
+
+  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+QuotaLimitTable
+
+Syntax: QuotaLimitTable source-type:source-info
+Default: None
+Context:
+Module: mod_quotatab
+Compatibility: 1.2.5rc2 and later
+
+This directive configures the information necessary for the module to locate
+and use the table containing the quota limit, the maximum number of bytes
+and/or files defined for use by specific users, groups, classes, etc, and is
+required for mod_quotatab to function.
+
+Please consult the relevant submodule documentation for details on that
+module's syntax for this configuration directive.
+
+See also: QuotaTallyTable
+
+  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+QuotaLog
+
+Syntax: QuotaLog file|"none"
+Default: None
+Context:
+Module: mod_quotatab
+Compatibility: 1.2.5rc2 and later
+
+The QuotaLog directive is used to a specify a log file for mod_quotatab
+reporting, and can be done a per-server basis. The file parameter must be
+the full path to the file to use for logging. Note that this path must not
+be to a world-writeable directory and, unless AllowLogSymlinks is explicitly
+set to on (generally a bad idea), the path must not be a symbolic link.
+
+If file is "none", no logging will be done at all; this setting can be used
+to override a QuotaLog setting inherited from a <Global> context.
+
+  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+QuotaShowQuotas
+
+Syntax: QuotaShowQuotas on|off
+Default: on
+Context:
+Module: mod_quotatab
+Compatibility: 1.2.5rc2 and later
+
+The QuotaShowQuotas directive can be used to enable/disable mod_quotatab's
+response to a SITE QUOTA request. For some sites, revealing the current
+quota information may be considered an unnecessary, perhaps even
+detrimental, information leak; other sites may consider this a definite
+feature.
+
+  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+QuotaTallyTable
+
+Syntax: QuotaTallyTable source-type:source-info
+Default: None
+Context:
+Module: mod_quotatab
+Compatibility: 1.2.5rc2 and later
+
+This directive configures the information necessary for the module to locate
+and use the table containing the quota tally, or the current byte/file
+counts for users, groups, classes, etc, and is required for mod_quotatab to
+function.
+
+Please consult the relevant submodule documentation for details on that
+module's syntax for this configuration directive.

+
+SITE QUOTA
+
+The SITE QUOTA command will display the quota, both the limit and the
+current tally, to the client. This SITE command accepts no parameters, and
+can only be used once the client has successfully logged in.
+
+Example:
+
+ftp> quote SITE QUOTA
+200-The current quota for this session are [current/limit]:
+ Name: tj
+ Quota Type: User
+ Per Session: True
+ Limit Type: Hard
+   Uploaded Kb:         unlimited
+   Downloaded Kb:       unlimited
+   Transferred Kb:      unlimited
+   Uploaded files:      1/1
+   Downloaded files:    unlimited
+   Transferred files:   unlimited
+200 Please contact root@familiar.castaglia.org if these entries are inaccurate
+ftp>
+
+Use of this SITE command can be controlled via <Limit>, e.g.:
+
+  <Limit SITE_QUOTA>
+    AllowUser tj
+    DenyAll
+  </Limit>
+
+Like many SITE commands, the FTP client will probably not recognize or
+support SITE QUOTA. Hopefully the client does have the ability to send
+arbitrary commands to the server, as the common ftp(1) client does via
+quote.
+
+The email address displayed in the SITE QUOTA output can be configured via
+the ServerAdmin directive.
+
+  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+Usage
+
+To use mod_quotatab's functionality, you must first define the tables that
+together contain the quota information.
+
+There are two such quota tables: one table for providing quota information
+about the absolute byte/file limits for users, groups, and classes, and a
+separate table for maintaining the current tally, or number of bytes/files
+used, for those same users, groups, and classes. This separation of
+information allows for a configuration such as using LDAP to efficiently
+distribute the limit information, and local SQL databases for efficiently
+storing the tally. The limit table is considered a read-only table, and is
+only accessed at the start of session in order to determine what the session
+limits should be. The tally table is accessed in read-write mode, and is
+updated after the relevant FTP commands have been processed.
+
+This module was not explicitly designed for easy interaction with other
+applications, but rather for other criteria:
+
+   * efficient lookups and updates
+   * no need for ~/.quota files
+   * no need of requirement for root privileges to access quotas
+   * easy support for an abstraction layer for storing quota information in
+     other formats
+   * support for a SITE command that allows users to view their current
+     quotas
+
+This module maintains its quotas based solely on FTP commands - it does not
+enforce quotas based on files that may have been added, deleted, or moved
+via shell access or any mechanism other than through the proftpd server.
+
+When a client logs in, assuming QuotaEngine is on, mod_quotatab will check
+the limit table for the record most appropriate for that client. This check
+first examines the table for records of type user that match the client's
+login name. If no such matching records are found, it checks for records of
+type group that match any of the user's groups (both primary and
+supplemental). Failing that, it will check for records of type class that
+belong to the class (if enabled) from which the client is connecting. If
+still no matching records are found, the table will be searched for a record
+of type all; if absent, the module will assume that no quotas apply to the
+client.
+
+Once the limits for the current session have been established, mod_quotatab
+examines the tally table to see what the current numbers in the matching
+tally record are. Should the client have an applicable limit record but no
+matching tally record, the module will initialize a new record in the tally
+table.
+
+For the purposes of tracking the number of uploaded bytes/files, the tally
+will be adjusted accordingly upon use of the following FTP commands: APPE
+(bytes only), DELE, STOR, and STOU. The number of bytes used for the
+calculation will be determined from the difference in file size of the file
+in question.
+
+For the purposes of tracking the number of downloaded bytes/files, the tally
+will be adjusted accordingly upon use of the following FTP commands: RETR.
+The number of bytes used for the calculation will be determined from the
+number of bytes sent to the client.
+
+For the purposes of tracking the number of transferred bytes/files, the
+tally will be adjusted accordingly upon use of the following FTP commands:
+APPE (bytes only), DELE, RETR, STOR, and STOU. The number of bytes used for
+the calculation will be determined from the number of bytes sent to the
+client. This type of limit allows for byte/file limits to be set that
+encompass both uploads and downloads.
+
+Note that if all three types of quotas are set (upload, download, and
+transfer), any quota reached will cause denial of FTP commands. This means
+that a high upload quota will never be reached if a low transfer quota is in
+effect. This holds true for bytes and files quota. For example, if a user
+has a limited number of both bytes and files to be uploaded in their limit
+record, the first limit reached (bytes or files) is the effective limit.
+Caveat emptor.
+
+For any quota limit that is set as "unlimited", mod_quotatab will not keep
+the tally. Many site administrators might want this ability, for accounting
+purposes. However, that ability is outside of the intended design of this
+module; other logging modules are much better suited for accounting purposes
+(e.g. mod_sql's SQLLog directive).
+
+If any developers wish to make use of mod_quotatab's quota information, or
+to develop a new submodule, there is developer documentation available here.
+
+  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+Installation
+
+To install mod_quotatab, follow these instructions. After unpacking the
+tarball, copy the mod_quotatab.c, mod_quotatab.h, mod_quotatab_file.c, and
+mod_quotatab_sql.c files into:
+
+  proftpd-dir/contrib/
+
+after unpacking the latest proftpd-1.2 source code. Follow the usual steps
+for using third-party modules in proftpd:
+
+  ./configure --with-modules=quotatab-modules
+  make
+  make install
+
+where quotatab-modules will depend on the types of quota tables you wish to
+support.
+
+For file-based quota tables, include the mod_quotatab_file submodule, e.g.:
+
+  mod_quotatab:mod_quotatab_file
+
+For SQL-based quota tables, include the mod_quotatab_sql submodule, e.g.:
+
+  mod_quotatab:mod_quotatab_sql
+
+And, if you wish to support file- and SQL-based quota tables:
+
+  mod_quotatab:mod_quotatab_file:mod_quotatab_sql
+
+Note that SQL tables require that a correct installation of mod_sql (and any
+of its backend modules) also be used. Consult the mod_sql documentation for
+installation instructions for that module.

+
+This program is distributed with the
+<a href="./mod_quotatab.html"><code>mod_quotatab</code></a> module for
+ProFTPD 1.2.  It is used to calculate the amount of disk space currently
+used by a given user and/or group.

+disk usage:
+<pre>
+  diskuse /home /usr /tmp --user=bob
+</pre>
+The <code>--K</code>, <code>--M</code>, and <code>--G</code> options can be
+used to display the disk usage calculated in kilobytes, megabytes, or
+gigabytes, respectively.
