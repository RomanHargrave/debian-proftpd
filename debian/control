Description: Versatile, virtual-hosting FTP daemon - binaries
 ProFTPD is a powerful modular FTP/SFTP/FTPS server. This File Transfer
 Protocol daemon supports also hidden directories, virtual hosts, and
 per-directory ".ftpaccess" files. It uses a single main configuration
 file, with a syntax similar to Apache.
 .
 Because of the advanced design, anonymous-FTP directories can have
 an arbitrary internal structure (bin, lib, etc, and special files are
 not needed). Advanced features such as multiple password files and
 upload/download ratios are also supported.
 .
 This package contains the daemon and all main modules used for
 common configurations. If you need database-centric authentication
 install the suitable proftpd-mod suggested package.
